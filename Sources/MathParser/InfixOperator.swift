/**
 Parser for left-associative infix operations. Takes a parser for operators to recognize and a parser for values to use
 with the operator which could include operations that are of higher precedence than those parsed by the first parser.

 NOTE: this parser will succeed if it can parse at least one operand value. This can be problematic if you want to
 have an alternative case for a failed binary expression.

 Based on InfixOperator found in the Arithmetic perf test of https://github.com/pointfreeco/swift-parsing
 If you want support for right-associative operators, check there for a more robust implementation that does both kinds.
